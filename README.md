# Direct Publisher to SDK Conversion template

This template enables Direct Publisher channels to be converted to SDK with minimal coding. For step-by-step instructions on converting RDP channels to SDK channels, see the [conversion guide](https://developer.roku.com/docs/direct-publisher/rdp-sdk-coversion-guide.md).

## Deploy

A convinient deploy script exists to help you deploy your in-development channel to your Roku device.

To use it make sure you know the IP address and password of your development Roku device:

```bash
$ ./sideload.sh YOUR_DEVICE_PASSWORD YOUR_DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS
```
